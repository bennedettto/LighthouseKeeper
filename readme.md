# Lighthouse Keeper

Lighthouse Keeper, a horror game in Unity engine.

## Premise

1931, during a raging storm on remote Black Harbour Isle, the player must keep the lighthouse burning to survive three days and nights. The light keeps “them” at bay — the Watchers, twisted remnants of those who came before.
But as the light cuts through the storm, another danger stirs: Ydris, the Watcher Below the Waves — an ancient god. The lighthouse was built on an ancient sacrificial site. Lighting the lighthouse is far worse than the darkness...

## Core Game Pillars

### 1. The Light Keeps You Safe… for Now

> *The beam wards off the Watchers. It is your only shield against the dark. But the longer it burns, the more attention it draws. Safety has a cost — and something far older is watching.*

### 2. You Are Utterly, Hopelessly Alone

> *No help is coming. No voices guide you. Only the wind, the waves, and the whispers in the dark. Your thoughts may not even be your own.*

### 3. Every Choice Leaves a Scar

> *Fuel spent, lights lit, places entered, letters read — everything has consequences. The island sees. The island remembers. The island reshapes.*

### 4. The Island Is Hostile and Alive

> *The weather isn't just ambiance — it hunts you. The island decays around you. Fog chokes the light. Rot creeps in. This place *wants* you gone.*

### 5. The Truth Hides in Ruin and Madness

> *There is no exposition, only evidence. Scraps, scars, symbols, hallucinations. The deeper you dig, the more the truth twists — and the less certain your own mind becomes.*

## How are Design Pillars Implemented

Every log, whisper, and environmental detail reinforces the core pillars — especially the tension between light as safety and danger. Story elements will emerge through exploration, never exposition, letting players feel isolation and consequence through fragmented truths and shifting realities. Every choice echo, every shadow suggest a presence, and every revelation leave the player more uncertain than before.


## Player Fantasy

The wind screams like it’s alive. Salt stings your eyes, rain lashes your face, and the sea wants to swallow the island whole. The lighthouse stands crooked against the storm — your only refuge. You sprint between failing machinery, broken stairs, and flickering lamps, desperate to keep the beacon burning. In the shadows beyond the cliffs, *they* wait — the Watchers — twisted figures that move when the light falters. You feel their presence before you see them: the pressure in your skull, the shapes in the fog, the scrape against glass. For a while, the light holds them back. For a while. But the island is rotting, and so is the truth. What began as a struggle to survive becomes something darker. The lighthouse doesn't just *protect* you — it *summons* something deeper. And the question grows louder with every heartbeat: is the storm your enemy… or your last warning?

##  High-Level Core Loop

**Check lighthouse systems → Gather fuel and supplies → Explore the island → Uncover narrative clues → Return before nightfall → Survive the night against the Watchers**

### Loop Summary

1. **Check Systems**

- Assess the lighthouse’s operational status: fuel levels, generator integrity, light output.
- Identify immediate needs before venturing out.

2. **Gather Fuel & Supplies**

- Refill the generator with diesel from scattered or locked storage locations.
- Collect tools, parts, and other survival essentials — often limited or hidden.

3. **Explore the Island**

- Navigate a shifting, hostile environment.
- Solve puzzles, access new areas, and encounter environmental storytelling.
- Manage time and safety as the storm intensifies.

4. **Uncover Narrative Clues**

- Find journal entries, symbols, and ghostly memories that build the lore.
- Interpret conflicting accounts and hallucinations to piece together what’s real.

5. **Return Before Nightfall**

- Time is limited. The Watchers emerge after dark, and being caught outside is lethal.
- Make it back, secure the lighthouse, and prepare for night.

6. **Survive the Night**

- Keep the light burning and defend the tower from supernatural intrusion.
- Respond to system failures, distortions, and increasingly surreal events.
- Endure until dawn — or don’t.
